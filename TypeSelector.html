     <h1> Type Selector</h1>
     <h2> All in one </h2>
     <p> Selectors in CSS are patterns that define which HTML elements should be styled.
         They play a crucial role in applying styles to specific parts of a webpage.
         Common selectors include element selectors (e.g., h1, p), class selectors (e.g., .button), and ID selectors (e.g., #header).
         Selectors help web developers target and style elements, creating the desired visual presentation for a website. </p>
